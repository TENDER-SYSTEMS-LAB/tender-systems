# TENDER SYSTEMS Wiki Schema

This document defines how to manage the Wiki; it is not part of the Wiki's subject matter. A new agent or person beginning work in this repository should be able to understand the entire operating system by reading only `schema.md`, `wiki/index.md`, and `wiki/current-state.md`.

This schema is the canonical convention for every TENDER SYSTEMS repository. Lab repositories, including `other-goods-lab` and `longing-lab`, instantiate this schema rather than defining their own from scratch.

## Layers

This repository has three layers:

- **`raw/`** — The Source of Truth. This layer preserves originals unchanged: conversation exports, documents, and unclassified material. Never replace or delete a file under `raw/`. If a correction is needed, add a new revision as a separate source instead of editing the existing file.
- **`wiki/`** — The LLM-maintained synthesis layer. It does not summarize one source in isolation; it combines multiple sources to maintain the best current model of the organization. The Wiki never replaces raw material. However well organized a Wiki page may be, the raw original remains the final evidence.
- **`schema.md`** — This document. It governs how the Wiki is managed rather than describing the organization's work itself.

## Language and Localization

English is the canonical language for all maintained documentation and the default language for public readers. This includes the root README, repository rules, Wiki pages, source-registry prose, headings, summaries, and log entries.

Registered raw sources are evidence and retain their original language. The English-default rule never permits rewriting a file under `raw/documents/`, `raw/conversations/`, or `raw/surveys/`. Promote its meaning into the Wiki in English, or register a translation as a separate derivative source when a full translation is genuinely required.

`README.md` remains the canonical English public entry point. Future public README translations use `README.<locale>.md`, such as `README.ko.md`, `README.zh-CN.md`, and `README.ja.md`. Broader translations may mirror canonical paths under `docs/i18n/<locale>/`. Every translation must identify its locale and canonical English source, must not add facts or decisions, and should be updated only after the English source changes.

## Navigation and History

Five documents that may appear similar serve different audiences and positions in time:

- **`README.md`** — The repository's public entry point. It explains what TENDER SYSTEMS is, what the organization currently operates, why the repository exists, and where to begin reading. Do not include a complete file tree or agent editing instructions.
- **`wiki/index.md`** — A content-oriented catalog for agents and Wiki editors. Excluding the index itself, register every Wiki page exactly once under its type using `link + one-line summary + updated date`; include status when the page has one. It also routes new information to the proper page. Do not remove an entry unless the page is deleted.
- **`wiki/current-state.md`** — A snapshot of currently valid decisions, scope, priorities, and unresolved questions.
- **`wiki/registry.md`** — The canonical catalog of systems operated by TENDER SYSTEMS.
- **`wiki/log.md`** — An append-only history of ingestion, meaningful queries, decisions, linting, and maintenance in the order they occurred. Do not edit an existing entry except during an explicitly authorized repository-wide migration that preserves its meaning.

Use `## [YYYY-MM-DD] <type> | <title>` for new log entry headings. Prefer `ingest`, `query`, `decision`, `lint`, or `maintenance` as the type. Do not record every ordinary conversation or read-only action when it leaves no result in the Wiki. Historical entries written in an older format need not be reformatted.

## Taxonomy

The current page types are:

- **index** — The working catalog for finding every Wiki page and editing destination by type.
- **overview** — A page explaining the overall concept of the organization.
- **current-state** — A page showing where the organization stands now.
- **registry** — The canonical catalog of systems operated by TENDER SYSTEMS. Each entry records: system ID, name, status, repository, one-line description, and related institutional documents.
- **concept** — A page for an idea that crosses several systems.
- **note** — A background record of inspiration, motivation, or reflection shared across works, retained for later recollection without making it an institutional principle or artistic philosophy.
- **decision** — A page recording a decision that affected institutional direction.
- **question** — A page for a central unresolved question.
- **log** — The append-only work history.

`wiki/systems/` (one page per system) is not created. Create it only when a single system accumulates institution-level knowledge that develops independently of that system's Lab repository — detail belonging only to that project still stays in its Lab repository. `collection` is a project-level page type used in `other-goods-lab`; it is not created here.

Add a taxonomy only when real material requires that page type; do not create directories or placeholders in advance.

## Status

A page or section may use one of eight status values:

- `confirmed` — Material confirmed by the user.
- `working` — A direction currently being developed.
- `hypothesis` — An idea not yet verified.
- `speculation` — A weakly supported conjecture.
- `deferred` — Material intentionally postponed.
- `rejected` — Material discarded after review.
- `deprecated` — Material that was once valid but is no longer valid.
- `unknown` — Material for which there is not yet enough evidence to judge.

Do not attach a status to every sentence. Use status only at page or section level.

## Attribution

Use five values to distinguish where information came from:

- `user-originated` — An idea first introduced by the user.
- `llm-proposed` — An idea proposed by an LLM.
- `jointly-developed` — An idea developed together through conversation.
- `user-confirmed` — Material explicitly accepted or decided by the user.
- `llm-synthesis` — A later LLM interpretation combining several sources.

The most important rule is: **Never transform an LLM proposal into a user decision in the record.** Material attributed as `llm-proposed` does not become `user-confirmed` until the user actually confirms or accepts it.

## Provenance

Every important claim must be traceable to a source ID through a `## Sources` section. For example:

```markdown
## Sources

- [[SRC-2026-09-05-example-document]] — [raw/documents/2026-09-05-example-document.md](../../raw/documents/2026-09-05-example-document.md)
```

Each entry carries two links. The `[[SRC-...]]` wikilink is the source identifier, shared by every page that rests on the same original. The Markdown link is the file itself, written relative to the page: `../raw/...` from a page directly under `wiki/`, `../../raw/...` from a page in a subdirectory.

When provenance is a secondary citation — that is, when the original conversation or material behind a claim is absent from the repository and appears only indirectly through another source — state that limit.

Keep provenance useful without making pages unmanageably metadata-heavy. Do not attach a citation to every sentence; collect sources at page level or by major claim.

## Promotion

Not every raw source becomes a Wiki page automatically. Information promoted to the Wiki should be worth consulting repeatedly, meaningful to the understanding of the organization, and supported by verifiable provenance.

- **Strong promotion** — Material directly confirmed or decided by the user. Record it in the Wiki with `user-confirmed` attribution.
- **Working promotion** — Material not yet confirmed but worth consulting throughout the organization's development. Record it with a status such as `hypothesis` or `working`.
- **Do not promote** — One-off chatter, meaningless LLM variants, duplicate phrasing, unsupported conjecture, or material that makes a discarded idea appear current. Leave it in raw.

Attribution and status must make the promotion level visible at all times.

## Page Frontmatter

Pages use minimal YAML frontmatter containing only these four fields. Do not add fields before a real need emerges.

- `status` — One of the eight values above.
- `attribution` — One of the five values above.
- `updated` — The date on which the page was last updated.
- `sources` — A list of source IDs supporting the page.

Example:

```yaml
---
status: hypothesis
attribution: llm-synthesis
updated: 2026-09-05
sources:
  - SRC-2026-09-05-example-document
---
```

## File Naming

- Decisions: `wiki/decisions/DEC-NNN-short-slug.md`
- Questions: `wiki/questions/Q-NNN-short-slug.md`
- Concepts: `wiki/concepts/short-slug.md`
- Notes: `wiki/notes/short-slug.md`
- Raw sources: `raw/<type>/YYYY-MM-DD-short-slug.md`, registered with the source ID `SRC-YYYY-MM-DD-short-slug`

Cross-link pages with `[[wikilink]]` syntax.

## Updates

When a new source arrives, check whether an existing page can be updated before creating a new page. Classify the relationship to existing knowledge as one of:

- **Correction** — Existing information was wrong.
- **Evolution** — Institutional thinking changed over time.
- **Alternative** — Different ideas coexist without conflict.
- **Unresolved contradiction** — There is not enough evidence to decide which side is right.

For an Evolution, add a `## Evolution` section that preserves the sequence from previous state → transition → current state. Never silently overwrite existing knowledge. A page must always show what changed and why.

## Deprecation and Rejection

Do not delete discarded ideas. Change the relevant page or section status to `rejected` or `deferred` and explain the reason under `## Why rejected`. This allows future readers to see that the idea was already considered and why it was set aside. Take care that rejected material does not appear current in the index, current state, or elsewhere.

## Deletion

Even when an original source is deleted or invalidated, do not remove its row from `raw/sources.md`. Change its `Wiki Status` to `invalidated` and record the reason. Do not delete Wiki material that depended only on that source; mark the relevant page or section `REVIEW_REQUIRED` so readers know it no longer has reliable support.

## Output Rules

When answering from the Wiki:

- Identify the source supporting the answer.
- Distinguish confirmed material (`confirmed`, `user-confirmed`) from hypotheses or speculation.
- Say when something is unknown. Never fabricate a plausible answer without evidence.
- Do not mix a user decision with an LLM interpretation; always distinguish where the judgment came from.

## Maintenance

Continuously watch for two conditions:

**(A) Single-source dependency** — Mark a review signal when an important conclusion depends on only one source. Even with several sources overall, a conclusion that rests on one derivative summary still has a single-source dependency.

**(B) Source-Wiki mismatch** — Periodically check whether original files have changed since registration. Compare `git hash-object <source path>` with the `Hash` column in `raw/sources.md`. If a value differs, do not update the Wiki automatically. Mark the relevant page `REVIEW_REQUIRED` for human review.

Verification command:

```bash
git hash-object raw/documents/*.md raw/conversations/*.md raw/surveys/*.md
```

## Scope Boundary

This repository is the institutional layer: it stores principles common to several systems, institution-level decisions, the system registry, cross-system relationships, shared conventions, and public identity. Detailed knowledge belonging only to one system stays canonical in that system's own Lab repository and is never duplicated here; when in doubt, apply the two questions in [[DEC-002-decision-placement]].

Background notes may also preserve inspiration and motivation shared across works when requested. Recording a recollection does not adopt it as a principle, a philosophy, or public copy; preserve its stated role and source attribution.

## Wiki Lint

As the Wiki grows, manually check:

- broken Wiki links
- orphan pages that nothing links to
- duplicate concepts
- pages that are excessively large or small
- stale pages that have not been updated for a long time
- missing provenance
- source hash mismatches
- rejected ideas presented as current
- mismatches between the index and current state
- single-source dependencies
- maintained documentation written in a language other than English
- project-level knowledge duplicated from a Lab repository

Lint should produce a report before making changes. Do not automatically repair findings at scale; list them, then let a person or agent judge and fix each one.

## Not in Scope

The following are intentionally absent:

- **A giant taxonomy** — Add page types only when several real pages need them.
- **Empty placeholder pages** — Create a page only when there is content to hold.
- **A `wiki/systems/` directory** — Create it only when a single system accumulates institution-level knowledge that develops independently of its Lab repository.
- **A `wiki/concepts/` or `wiki/questions/` directory** — Create either only when real material requires that page type.
- **An automated lint script** — Create it only when the page count exceeds what the manual checklist can handle.
- **RAG** — Do not introduce a vector database or embeddings yet. The registered sources and Wiki pages remain small enough to navigate through `wiki/index.md` and text search. Reconsider only if keyword search frequently misses relevant documents, synonyms cause search failures, or the index no longer provides sufficient navigation.
